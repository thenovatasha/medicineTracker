# Introduction

Your medicine tracking, done right!

Ever forgot whether you took your scheduled dose of a medicine? Reminders are ignored, and you forget to log your medicine intake?

This app solves it by automatically tracking it for you! If you find yourself confused, just look at the display of the app, and you'll immediately see how many medicines should be remaining in your current leaf.

If you see that there is a discrepancy (maybe you forgot a couple of days), you can adjust it in the app with a single click so that the schedule is on track again.
